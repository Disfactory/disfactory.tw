Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But a View object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored. See documentation for each option for more\n * information.\n *\n * The *rotation constraint* snaps to specific angles. It is determined\n * by the following options: `enableRotation` and `constrainRotation`.\n * By default the rotation value is snapped to zero when approaching the\n * horizontal.\n *\n * The *center constraint* is determined by the `extent` option. By\n * default the center is not constrained at all.\n *\n  * @api\n */\nvar View = /*@__PURE__*/(function (BaseObject) {\n  function View(opt_options) {\n    BaseObject.call(this);\n\n    var options = assign({}, opt_options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>}\n     */\n    this.hints_ = [0, 0];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<Array<Animation>>}\n     */\n    this.animations_ = [];\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number|undefined}\n     */\n    this.updateAnimationKey_;\n\n    this.updateAnimations_ = this.updateAnimations_.bind(this);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @const\n     * @type {import(\"./proj/Projection.js\").default}\n     */\n    this.projection_ = createProjection(options.projection, 'EPSG:3857');\n\n    this.applyOptions_(options);\n  }\n\n  if ( BaseObject ) View.__proto__ = BaseObject;\n  View.prototype = Object.create( BaseObject && BaseObject.prototype );\n  View.prototype.constructor = View;\n\n  /**\n   * Set up the view with the given options.\n   * @param {ViewOptions} options View options.\n   */\n  View.prototype.applyOptions_ = function applyOptions_ (options) {\n\n    /**\n     * @type {Object<string, *>}\n     */\n    var properties = {};\n    properties[ViewProperty.CENTER] = options.center !== undefined ?\n      options.center : null;\n\n    var resolutionConstraintInfo = createResolutionConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.maxResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.maxResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minResolution_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minResolution;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.zoomFactor_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.zoomFactor;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Array<number>|undefined}\n     */\n    this.resolutions_ = options.resolutions;\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {number}\n     */\n    this.minZoom_ = resolutionConstraintInfo.minZoom;\n\n    var centerConstraint = createCenterConstraint(options);\n    var resolutionConstraint = resolutionConstraintInfo.constraint;\n    var rotationConstraint = createRotationConstraint(options);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {Constraints}\n     */\n    this.constraints_ = {\n      center: centerConstraint,\n      resolution: resolutionConstraint,\n      rotation: rotationConstraint\n    };\n\n    if (options.resolution !== undefined) {\n      properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = options.resolution;\n    } else if (options.zoom !== undefined) {\n      properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = this.constrainResolution(\n        this.maxResolution_, options.zoom - this.minZoom_);\n\n      if (this.resolutions_) { // in case map zoom is out of min/max zoom range\n        properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION] = clamp(\n          Number(this.getResolution() || properties[ViewProperty.RESOLUTION]),\n          this.minResolution_, this.maxResolution_);\n      }\n    }\n    properties[ViewProperty.ROTATION] = options.rotation !== undefined ? options.rotation : 0;\n    this.setProperties(properties);\n\n    /**\n     * @private\n     * @type {ViewOptions}\n     */\n    this.options_ = options;\n\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Get an updated version of the view options used to construct the view.

The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.
